# Supplementary Material

On this page, I will post additional resources and supplementary material for the course.

## Resources for R

In this course, we will use R as the main computational tool. Below are some resources:

  - [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Grolemund and Wickham.
  - [Hands-On Programming with R](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/ighbo26t3ua52t/igp9099yy4v10/igz7vp4w5su9/OReilly_HandsOn_Programming_with_R_2014.pdf) by Grolemund.
  - Jenny Bryan's course on [Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R](https://stat545.com/)
    + In particular, I recommend the notes on [The Many Flavours of R objects](https://stat545.com/block004_basic-r-objects.html)
  - Mine Cetinkaya's curated list of [resources for R](https://github.com/rstudio-education/rstats-ed)
  - If you're looking for a deep understanding of R, I recommend Hadley Wickham's book [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)
  - RStudio has several great [cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) on their website. In particular, I recommend:
    + [Data transformation](https://442r58kc8ke1y38f62ssb208-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)
    + [Data visualization](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)
    + [Rmarkdown](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)
