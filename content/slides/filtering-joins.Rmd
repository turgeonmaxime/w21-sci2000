## Lecture Objectives

  - Understand the difference between a mutating join and a filtering join
  - Be able to recognize when to use each type
  - Be able to transform datasets using set operations

## Motivation

  - In the previous lecture, we talked about **mutating joins**.
    + Create new dataset by combining two datasets with a common variable
  - Today we will talk about **filtering joins**.
    + Filter a dataset based on its relationship with another dataset
  - For completeness, we will also talk about set operations that can be used with relational data.
  
## Filtering joins in general

  - The starting point is still the same:
    + We have two `data.frame`s `x` and `y`
    + They have a variable in common that allows us to match rows across
  - In filtering joins, we want to filter the rows of `x` based on their relationship with the rows of `y`.
    + In particular, the output of a filtering join is a *subset* of `x`.
  
## Semijoin

  - In a **semijoin**, we only keep the rows of `x` with a corresponding match in `y`

## Example {.allowframebreaks}

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

df_beers <- read_csv("beers.csv")
df_breweries <- read_csv("breweries.csv")
```

```{r}
# Top 5 states for # breweries
state_top5 <- df_breweries %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  top_n(5)
```


```{r}
state_top5
```


```{r}
breweries_top5 <- semi_join(df_breweries,
                            state_top5)
```


```{r}
breweries_top5
```

```{r}
# Only keep beers from these states
semi_join(df_beers,
          breweries_top5,
          by = "brewery_id") %>% 
  count(style, sort = TRUE)
```

## Antijoin

  - In an **antijoin**, we only keep the rows of `x` *without* a corresponding match in `y`
  
<center>
![](join-anti.png)
</center>

## Example {.allowframebreaks}

```{r}
# Let's look at the other states
breweries_nottop5 <- anti_join(df_breweries,
                               state_top5)
```


```{r}
breweries_nottop5
```

```{r}
# Only keep beers from these states
semi_join(df_beers,
          breweries_nottop5,
          by = "brewery_id") %>% 
  count(style, sort = TRUE)
```

## Exercise

<center>
Filter the dataset `flights` from the `nycflights13` package to only show flights with planes that have flown at least 100 flights.
</center>

## Solution {.allowframebreaks}

```{r}
library(nycflights13)

planes100 <- flights %>% 
  count(tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n >= 100)
```

```{r}
flights100 <- semi_join(flights,
                        planes100)
```

```{r}
# Do we get flights with missing
# tail number?
flights100 %>% 
  filter(is.na(tailnum)) %>% 
  nrow
```

```{r}
# We can remove these NAs from planes100
planes100 <- filter(planes100,
                    !is.na(tailnum))
# Or we can remove them from flights100
flights100 <- filter(flights100,
                     !is.na(tailnum))
```

## Some tips about joins

  - You can join using more than one variable:
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
inner_join(x, y, by = c("var1", "var2"))
```

  - You can join even when the same variable is named differently:
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
inner_join(x, y, by = c("name1" = "name2"))
```


## Set operations {.allowframebreaks}

  - Here, the setup is slightly different.
    + We still have two `data.frame`s `x` and `y`.
    + But we assume they have **exactly** the same variables.
  - We want to create a new dataset `z` that will also have the same variables as `x` and `y`.
  - There are three different set operations:
    + **Union**: `z` has the unique observations from `x` and `y`.
    + **Intersection**: `z` has the observations common between `x` and `y`.
    + **Set difference**: `z` has the observations from `x` that are not in `y`.
    
```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df1 <- tibble(
  x = c(1, 2),
  y = c(1, 1)
)
df2 <- tibble(
  x = c(1, 1),
  y = c(1, 2)
)
```

```{r}
# Note that we get 3 rows, not 4
# because of duplicates
union(df1, df2)
```


```{r}
intersect(df1, df2)
```

\vspace{2cm}

```{r}
setdiff(df1, df2)
```

\vspace{2cm}

```{r}
# The order is important!
setdiff(df2, df1)
```

## Exercise

<center>
Find the states with at least 30 breweries. Create a dataset that contains information about beers from these states. Using linear regression, investigate whether there is a significant difference between the average ABV for beers from these states.
</center>

## Solution {.allowframebreaks}

  - There are several ways of doing this, but a key observation is that we need the variable `state` to appear in the final dataset, otherwise we can't use it as a covariate.
  - This suggests that the final dataset should be created using a *mutating* join.
  - Given that we only want beers from some states, we also want to choose an **inner join**.
  - Finally, the inner join should be between `df_beers` and the subset of `df_breweries` corresponding to these top states.
  
```{r}
# One solution: group by state
# and use n() inside filter
breweries_30 <- df_breweries %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  filter(n() >= 30) # n() counts per group

dataset <- inner_join(df_beers,
                      breweries_30,
                      by = "brewery_id")
```

\vspace{2cm}

```{r}
count(dataset, state, sort = TRUE)
```

\vspace{2cm}

```{r}
fit <- lm(abv ~ state, data = dataset)
fit
```

\vspace{2cm}

```{r}
confint(fit)
```

```{r}
# Alternatively, we can use a semijoin
# to create breweries_30
breweries_top <- df_breweries %>% 
  count(state) %>% 
  filter(n >= 30)

breweries_30 <- semi_join(df_breweries,
                          breweries_top)
```
