## Lecture Objectives

  - Understand the difference between the different types of mutating joins
  - Be able to choose and select the appropriate mutating join

## Motivation

  - For the first part of the course, we focused on the *data analysis* part of data science.
    + It probably felt like a sped-up version of STAT 1150
  - The datasets we analyzed were provided either as part of packages, or as a single CSV file.
  - In the second part of the course, we will discuss some strategies for collecting and combining datasets.

## Relational data {.allowframebreaks}

  - So far we've looked at data that fits neatly into a `data.frame`.
    + Each row is an observation, and for each observation we collected the **same** variables.
  - This is not the only way to store data. Let's look at an example: university course enrollment data.
    + For every student we need to collect personal information. 
    + For every course we need to collect specific information.
  - Clearly these datasets should be separate; you can think of them as two different `data.frame`s.
  - **Question**: How should we store information about which courses students are taking?
  - Should we add the name of courses to the student `data.frame` as new variables? How many variables should we create?
  - Should we add the name of students to the course `data.frame` as new variables? How many variables should we create?
  - **A better solution**: Create a *new* dataset, where each row corresponds to a pair (student, course).
  - **Why does this work?** Each student has a **unique** identifier, and so does each course. 
  
\vspace{1cm}
  
  - To create a class list:
    + Filter the (student, course) `data.frame` to only keep pairs for a given course.
    + Look up which students appear in the filtered dataset
    + Keep relevant personal information (e.g. student number, major, degree)
  - The process of "looking up" is called a **mutating join**.
  
## Example {.allowframebreaks}

  - This dataset is separated into two CSV files:
    + One contains a list of 2,410 US craft beers
    + The other contains data on 510 US breweries
  - The beers and breweries datasets have a variable in common, called `brewery_id`. 

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

df_beers <- read_csv("beers.csv")
df_breweries <- read_csv("breweries.csv")

glimpse(df_beers)
glimpse(df_breweries)
```

## Mutating joins

  - **Mutating joins** create a new dataset by combining two datasets and respecting their relationship.
    + This relationship is encoded by a common variable (or set of variables), often a unique identifier.
  - The main idea is as follows:
    + Take a row from the first dataset
    + Find a matching row in the second dataset
    + Create a new row by concatenating the two rows
  - The different types of mutating joins differ in how they handle cases with no matches.

## Inner join

  - In inner joins, we only create a new row if we can match rows from both datasets.

</center>

## Example {.allowframebreaks}

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

dataset <- inner_join(df_beers,
                      df_breweries,
                      by = "brewery_id")
glimpse(dataset)
```

```{r}
# dataset and df_beers have the same # of rows
nrow(dataset) == nrow(df_beers)
# dataset has one less than the sum of # cols
c(ncol(dataset), ncol(df_beers), ncol(df_breweries))
```

## Exercise

<center>
Find the state with the highest average of alcohol by volume (`abv`) per beers.
</center>

## Solution {.allowframebreaks}

  - Now that the datasets are joined, we can use `group_by` and `summarise`.
  
```{r}
dataset %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(avg_abv = mean(abv)) %>% 
  filter(avg_abv == max(avg_abv))
```

```{r}
# What went wrong?
# Let's look at the data
dataset %>% 
  filter(is.na(abv)) %>% 
  glimpse
```

```{r}
# NA in abv trickles down to the average
dataset %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(avg_abv = mean(abv))
```

```{r}
# Solution: na.rm = TRUE in mean
dataset %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(avg_abv = mean(abv, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(avg_abv == max(avg_abv))
```

## Left/right join {.allowframebreaks}

  - But what if we want to keep rows from a dataset that don't have a matching row in the other dataset?
  - Left and right (outer) joins will do just that and replace the non-matching row with `NA`s.
  - Left and right refer to the dataset from which we want to keep rows.
    + `left_join(x, y)` will keep rows of `x`
    + `right_join(x, y)` will keep rows of `y`

<center>
![](join-left-right.png)
</center>

## Example {.allowframebreaks}

```{r}
library(nycflights13)

# Information about flights
glimpse(flights)
# Information about airplanes
glimpse(planes)
```

```{r}
# How many flights? How many planes?
c(nrow(flights), nrow(planes))

# How many flights have matching plane?
inner_join(flights, planes, by = "tailnum") %>% 
  nrow
```

```{r}
# With left_join, we keep all flights
left_join(flights, planes, by = "tailnum") %>% 
  glimpse
```

## Full join

 - The full join allows us to keep unmatched rows from **both** datasets.

<center>
![](join-full.png)
</center>

## Exercise

<center>
The `flights` dataset contains information about departure and arrival delays (`dep_delay` and `arr_delay`). Compute the average delays for each manufacturing year (i.e. the year the plane was manufactured). Plot the relationship between these two quantities. Do you see any evidence of an association?
</center>

## Solution {.allowframebreaks}

```{r}
# First we combine the two datasets 
# and create tot_delay variable
# Note: Could also use inner_join
dataset <- left_join(flights,        
                     planes,
                     by = "tailnum") %>% 
  mutate(tot_delay = dep_delay + arr_delay)
```

```{r error = TRUE}
# Next group by year and summarise
data_avg <- dataset %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(tot_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
# What happened?
# Both flights and planes have a variable year
# year.y refers to the one from planes
names(dataset)
```

```{r}
# Try again
data_avg <- dataset %>% 
  group_by(year.y) %>% 
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(tot_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
data_avg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year.y,
             y = avg_delay)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Summary

  - Not all data is neatly packaged into CSV files.
  - Often the data we need is spread over multiple datasets.
  - If these datasets have a matching variable, we can create a new dataset with matching rows using **mutating joins**.
  - Choosing between an inner join, left/right join or full join depends on what we want to do with unmatched rows.
    + Do we keep all of them? Only those from one of the two datasets?
