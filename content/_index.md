# General Information

This is the course website for **SCI 2000: Introduction to Data Science**. This course aims to provide students with an introduction to data science. Specifically, this course will introduce you to tools and hands-on experience needed to analyse data. By the end of the course, students will:

 - Become proficient in `R`, to the level that they can analyse data using the tools from this class.
 - Be able to describe and analyze data through visualization and simple statistical procedures.
 - Be introduced to statistical thinking and be able to think critically about variation and biases.

### Prerequisites

Instructor approval.

### Textbook

There is **no** textbook for this course. Notes will be provided to students through UM Learn, along with additional resources.

### Assessments

The assessments for this course include:

  - Four (4) assignments.
  - Three (3) data analysis summaries.
  - One (1) final project.

## Outline of Topics

The course is expected to cover the following topics:

  - Data visualization
  - Data wrangling
  - Relational data
  - Web scraping
  - Introduction to regular expressions
  - (If time permites) Automation and version control

Throughout the course, the applied topics above will be complemented with an introduction to statistical thinking: how to think about variability, what biases can occur in the data, and how to perform simple statistical procedures (e.g. comparing means, proportions, linear regression).

## Statistical Software

The course requires you to make extensive use of the R statistical software for your assignments and final data project. Sample codes will be provided to students. 

You can download `R` for free (for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Solaris) from the *Comprehensive R Archive Network* at: https://cran.r-project.org/

For additional resources on `R`, see [here]({{< ref "suppl.md" >}}).
